PartyP v0.1b
This is an addon for Windower that displays Party HP% horizontally across the screen just above the chat box.
Changing the X and Y pos in the setting.xml will adjust the placement of the first in the list (the player).
Adjusting the step size changes how far apart the displays are for each party member.
Adjusting the font_size changes the size of the font displayed.

Changelog 0.1b
PartyP correctly reads the settings file now.
